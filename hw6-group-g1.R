# We assume alpha = 0.05 for all tests.

# 1. Are reaction times affected by the number of trials?
# 2 DOF, two-sided test: Pr(|t| < 4.303) = .95
# No: |t| = 2.435

model1 = lm(RT ~ Trial, lexdec)
print(paste("Is reaction time affected by the number of trials only?", ttest(model1, 'Trial', 2)))


# 2. Are reaction times affected by the number of trials,
# taking Subject and Word differences (their varying means) into account?
# 5 DOF, two-sided test: Pr(|t| < 2.571) = .95
# Yes: |t| = 2.647 > 2.571

model2 = lmer(RT ~ Trial + (1|Subject) + (1|Word), lexdec)

# 3. Are reaction times also affected by the native language?
# 6 DOF, two-sided test: Pr(|t| < 2.447) = .95
# Yes (native language): |t| = 2.573 > 2.447
# Yes (trials): |t| = 2.647 > 2.447

# 4. Subjects are affected differently depending on the number of trials.
# 7 DOF, two-sided test: Pr(|t| < 2.365) = .95
# !! The model does not converge. As such the t-values can not be used for predictions,
#    but if we could, this would be the results:
# No (trials): |t| = 1.369 > 2.365
# Yes (native language): |t| = 2.913 > 2.365
