# 1. Are reaction times affected by the number of trials?
# 2 DOF, one-sided test: Pr(|t| < 2.92) = .95
# No: |t| = 2.435

model1 = lm(RT ~ Trial, lexdec)
print(paste("Is reaction time affected by the number of trials only?", ttest(model1, 'Trial', 2)))


# 2. Are reaction times affected by the number of trials,
# taking Subject and Word differences (their varying means) into account?
# 5 DOF, one-sided test: Pr(|t| < 2.015) = .95
# Yes: |t| = 2.647 > 2.015

# 3. Are reaction times also affected by the native language?
# 6 DOF, one-sided test: Pr(|t| < 1.943) = .95
# Yes (native language): |t| = 2.573 > 1.943
# Yes (trials): |t| = 2.647 > 1.943

# 4. Subjects are affected differently depending on the number of trials.
# 7 DOF, one-sided test: PR(-1.895 < t < 1.895) = .95
# !! The model does not converge. As such the t-values can not be used for predictions,
#    but if we could, this would be the results:
# No (trials): |t| = 1.369 > 1.415
# Yes (native language): |t| = 2.913 > 1.415
